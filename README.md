Hello there, DarklyTornado here. I have created a new Telegram bot just for you peeps! It is a self made simple Telegram CC scrapper!
To start using this FREE program, you can follow these simple instructions:

1. Download the latest release.
2. Extract the Python bot file from the latest release zip file you downloaded to a empty new directory. 
- Open the Python file in a text editor and replace all needed information with instructions from step 3 and also your BotFather bot token & owner Telegram user ID!
3. Then generate an Telegram API ID & hash from the following website: my.telegram.org/auth
4. Fill in the stuff as mentioned, and then you may perform the following command to install needed libraries: pip install python-telegram-bot --upgrade
5. Run the Python file, fill in your Telegram account phone number and provide the OTP, and perform all needed steps, and your bot will be running!

Go to your bot and perform the /start command to start running your bot! You can scrape almost any amount of CCs from any Telegram public channel!
